#### Overview

The ResultsPagination component provides pagination for the search results in the SearchResults component. It includes options to change the current page displayed, page size, and choices to include in the page size selector. There's also an option to show/hide the page size selector.

##### Carbon Props

The ResultsPagination component uses [Carbon's Pagination component](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/components/src/components/pagination) as a basis, and lets you pass in any props from that component that are not already being used. These will get passed into the Pagination component. You can see what additional props are available at [Carbon's storybook page](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/pagination--pagination).
