Interest shall not accrue or be payable on any monies which are the subject of a disputed invoice or where monies are offset pursuant to Clause 5.10. 5.16 The Parties agree that the right to claim interest under Clause 5.15 is a substantial remedy for late payment and is in substitution for any statutory or other right to claim interest and/or other remedy for late payment under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. 5.17 Buyer may retain the Retention Fee (if any) until the relevant Milestone to which the Retention Fee relates has been achieved, where set out in the SOW.

Supplier and Buyer agree to cooperate to minimize, wherever possible and appropriate, any applicable Taxes and provide reasonable notice and cooperation in connection with any audit. Each party shall bear sole responsibility for all taxes, assessments, or other levies on its own income, leased or purchased property, equipment or software. If Buyer provides a direct pay certificate, certification of an exemption from Tax or reduced rate of Tax imposed by an applicable taxing authority, then Supplier agrees not to invoice or pay any such Tax unless and until the applicable taxing authority assesses such Tax, at which time Supplier shall invoice and Buyer agrees to pay any such Tax that is legally owed. 6.2 Buyer may withhold taxes as required under applicable law on payments made to Supplier hereunder and shall be required to remit to Supplier only the net proceeds thereof.

The parties will enter into a separate agreement governing the transmission of such electronic transactions and associated responsibilities of the parties. 9.0 Timetable and Delays 9.1 Subject to Clause 10 (Buyer Obligations), and Clause 22.9 (Force Majeure) the Supplier shall: 9.1.1 perform the Services so as to achieve any Key Milestones and delivery of the associated Deliverables by the corresponding Milestone Dates. 9.1.2 use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) provide all other Deliverables in accordance with the Delivery Dates (if any) set out in the Timetable; and (ii) achieve Milestones (other than Key Milestones) by the corresponding Milestone Dates. 9.2 The Supplier shall, within 1 Working Day, notify in writing the applicable Buyer Authorised Representative stated in the SOW if it considers that there shall be or may be a delay in meeting any date in the Timetable or in achieving a Milestone by the relevant Milestone Date, or otherwise in the performance of the Services and provision of any Deliverables by a Delivery Date, giving to Buyer, either together with such notification or as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards, written details of causes for and potential impact of any such delay and its recommendations for correcting or minimising the impact of the delay. 9.3 If any Milestone is not achieved by the applicable Milestone Date, or a Deliverable and/or Services are not delivered or performed by the applicable Delivery Date, then the Supplier shall take all such additional steps necessary to achieve such Delivery Date or Milestone as early as reasonably practicable thereafter at no extra cost to Buyer, provided always that where such delay or non-performance is not due to a Supplier Fault then the Supplier shall be entitled to charge for any and all additional costs reasonably incurred as a result of such delay in accordance with the Agreed Rates, such charges to be agreed between the parties in writing. 9.4 Without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 9.3, if any Milestone is not achieved by the applicable Milestone Date, or a Deliverable and/or Services are not delivered or performed by the applicable Delivery Date or fail to meet the agreed Acceptance Criteria within the period set out in the relevant Timetable, and such failure is as a result of a Supplier Fault then Supplier shall repair or replace such Deliverables or re-perform such Services, without charge by the revised date notified to Supplier by Buyer (provided that such notice shall be either (i) not less than twenty (20) Working Days after the originally scheduled delivery date; or (ii) after the end of any Liquidated Damages Period as detailed in Clause 9.5 below (whichever is later) (“ Delay Remedy Period ”)). If Delivery is not achieved by such Delay Remedy Period due to Supplier Fault or Supplier is not able to repair or replace then the Buyer shall be entitled to terminate the relevant SOW in whole or in part, for Supplier Fault and receive a refund in respect of the element or elements of the Deliverables(s) and/or Services which were not so delivered or accepted. 9.5 In addition to the Buyer’s rights under Clause 9.4, if the Supplier fails to deliver a Deliverable and/or perform the Services, by any applicable Delivery Date, or achieve a Key Milestone by the applicable Milestone Date, and if the parties have expressly agreed in the relevant SOW that Liquidated Damages will apply, then the following provisions will apply: 9.5.2 the Supplier shall pay to Buyer the applicable Liquidated Damages , if any are specified in the SOW, for the applicable Liquidated Damages Period; 9.5.3 Buyer and the Supplier agree that the Liquidated Damages are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and represent a genuine pre-estimate of the likely losses that Buyer is likely to suffer as a result of the failure to deliver the relevant Deliverable and/or perform the relevant Services or achieve the relevant Key Milestone by the applicable Delivery Date or Key Milestone Date and represent the Buyer’s sole remedy (save for termination pursuant to Clause 9.4) in respect of any failure by the Supplier to meet such Delivery date or Milestone Date; and 9.6 The Supplier shall promptly notify in writing the Buyer whenever the Supplier reasonably believes that any failure of any Dependency or Force Majeure Event is likely to delay the achievement of a Key Milestone by the applicable Milestone Date. In such circumstances, the provisions of Clauses 9.7 to 9.8 shall apply. 9.7 Upon receiving notification from the Supplier under Clause 9.6 above, the parties’ Relationship Managers shall convene as soon as practicable onto discuss all aspects of the relevant circumstances including (i) the failure of the Dependency and/or Force Majeure Event and its effect on the Supplier's ability to achieve the relevant Key Milestone by any applicable Milestone Date; (ii) any workaround or other action necessary to mitigate the failure of any Dependency; and (iii) the appropriate relief (if any) which should be afforded to Supplier, which may include an extension to one or more of the Milestone Dates within the Timetable. For the avoidance of doubt in circumstances where Buyer does grant such extension of time the Supplier shall not be in breach of this Base Agreement or the relevant SOW as a result of its failure to achieve the relevant Milestone by the original Milestone Date). In conducting the discussions under this Clause 9.7 both parties shall act reasonably and in good faith and without undue delay.

For example, a failure by Buyer to meet a particular deadline may have knock on effects for planned work “windows” which may delay the relevant Milestone by a period in excess of Buyer’s delay taken in isolation. 10.5 If the Buyer makes available to Supplier any facilities or Materials in connection with Supplier’s and the Buyer’s performance of Services (including facilities and Materials belonging to the Customer), the Buyer is responsible for obtaining any licences or approvals related to those resources that may be necessary for Supplier to perform the Services. 11.0 Acceptance Criteria The Services and/or Deliverables shall be tested and accepted in accordance with the applicable Acceptance Criteria and Acceptance Tests set out in this Base Agreement including the provisions of Clause 9.0 and the relevant SOW. 12.0 Supplier Responsibilities 12.1 The Supplier shall perform the Services in accordance with Good Industry Practice. 12.2 The Supplier shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist the Buyer to ensure that the performance of the Services does not result in the degradation and/or the interruption of the business, systems and equipment of Customer where the Supplier is either: 12.2.1 aware that the degradation and/or interruption will occur or that there is a material risk that the degradation and/or interruption could occur; or 12.2.2 ought reasonably to be aware that the degradation and/or interruption will occur or that there is a material risk that the degradation could occur having regard to the Supplier's actual knowledge of the business, systems and equipment of Customer, other than: 12.2.3 where provided for in and in accordance with the Timetable; 12.2.4 where the Supplier has notified Buyer with twelve (12) Working Days notice in advance of a scheduled downtime and the timing, duration and impact of such downtime has been agreed in writing in advance with Buyer ; 12.2.5 where carried out by the Supplier during any agreed maintenance windows recorded in the relevant SOW; or 12.2.6 as otherwise agreed between the parties in writing, (each an \"Agreed Interruption\" ) in each case provided that such Agreed Interruption is carried out in accordance with the terms of the relevant SOW. 12.3 Unless otherwise specified in the relevant SOW, the Supplier shall be responsible for providing all materials, parts, components, items, Personnel and resources necessary to perform the Services and/or provide the Deliverables. 12.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Supplier to undertake any regulated activities which would require the Supplier to be authorised or registered by any regulatory body or authority having power or authority over Buyer, unless otherwise expressly agreed in the relevant SOW. 12.5 The Supplier shall, in connection with the performance of the Services and the provision of the Deliverables co-operate with the Consortium Members to the extent reasonably required by Buyer.

The Supplier shall be entitled to require, as a condition of allowing such access, an Audit Right Holder to enter into confidentiality undertakings (which are consistent with and no more stringent than the confidentiality undertakings under Clause 22.7 (Exchange of Information)) in respect of, and to be supervised during, such access, provided that it is permissible under Relevant Laws for Buyer, Customer and the Supplier to require this as a condition of such access. 32.3 If the audit access provided under Clause 32.2 reveals any non-compliances by the Supplier of the Agreement, then, without limiting any other rights or remedies of Buyer the Supplier agrees and undertakes to remedy such non-compliances. 32.4 If any audit reveals any overcharging by the Supplier on any invoice(s), an appropriate correcting credit shall be made within fourteen (14) days of such overcharge being identified. The correcting credit shall be equivalent to the amount of the overcharge plus interest at the Default Interest Rate, payable from the date payment of the overcharge was made by Buyer up to and including the date the correcting credit is made. If any audit reveals any undercharging by the Supplier on any invoice(s), the Supplier issue an invoice for the undercharged amount. 32.5 The Supplier shall promptly and efficiently give any Audit Right Holders any assistance they reasonably require in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Clause 32. 32.6 In the event that Buyer (or any member of the Customer Group) is the subject of any investigation or request for information from the FSA or any other regulatory authorities to which the relevant member of the Customer Group is subject, to the extent that such investigation or request for information has any connection with or involves in any way the Services and/or Deliverables provided by the Supplier under the relevant SOW, the Supplier agrees to provide all information, assistance and access including making its employees available as necessary and making any of its records and information available as evidence as Buyer may reasonably request to enable it to comply with the requests or requirements of the relevant regulators. The Supplier will comply with its obligations under this Clause 32.6 at no cost to Buyer. 32.7 Buyer’s and Customer's Regulatory Authorities shall have the benefit of any rights of audit and access to information and documentation provided for in this Agreement to the extent that they relate to the exercise of the Regulatory Authorities' legal rights and/or responsibilities. 33.0 Not used 34.0 Benchmarking If: a) Buyer wishes to carry out any benchmarking exercises in respect of the Services and/or b) Buyer requires obligations to be placed on the Supplier in connection with, or arising out of such, benchmarking exercise, then the terms applicable to such benchmarking exercises shall be as set out in the applicable SOW. Nothing in this Clause 34 is intended to limit Buyer’s ability to independently carry out benchmarking exercises in respect of the Services and/or Deliverables for any reason. 35.0 Conflicts of Interest 35.1 The Supplier shall ensure that during the term of the SOW no Conflict of Interest shall exist or arise in the performance of its obligations under the SOW between itself (and its Personnel), Buyer or any member of the Customer Group, nor shall any circumstance exist or arise which may restrict or conflict with the Supplier's performance obligations under the relevant SOW. 35.2 If during the course of the SOW any such Conflict of Interest, restriction, risk of conflict or risk of restriction arises, the Supplier undertakes to give Buyer immediate written notification of the same. If Buyer has reasonable grounds for believing that the Supplier is in breach of the provisions of this Clause 35 it shall notify the Supplier and if the Supplier cannot refute those grounds within thirty (30) days then Buyer shall have the right to terminate the SOW under Clause 21.1 (Termination of a SOW or WA). 36.0 Change Control Procedure (and Contract Changes) 36.1 Save as expressly provided otherwise in this Base Agreement or relevant SOW, each Change shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 36. A Change shall not be effective unless agreed and documented by the parties in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 36. 36.2 The Supplier shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to any Change relating to the performance of any service, functions and responsibilities (including any incidental services, functions or responsibilities) reasonably required for or related to the proper performance of existing Services. 36.3 Buyer and the Supplier shall discuss any Change proposed by either party and such discussion shall result in either: a) agreement in writing not to proceed further with the Change; b) a written request for a Change by Buyer; or c) a recommendation for a Change by the Supplier. 36.4 Where a written request for a Change is received from Buyer, the Supplier shall, unless otherwise agreed, submit a note substantially in the form set out in Section 2 of this Base Agreement (Form of Change Control Note) (\" Change Control Note \") to Buyer within twelve (12) Working Days (or such other time as the parties may agree in writing) containing the information set out on Acceptance Testing as detailed in the relevant SOW and any other relevant information. 36.5 A recommendation for a Change by the Supplier shall be submitted as a Change Control Note at the time of such recommendation. 36.6 For each Change Control Note submitted by the Supplier, Buyer shall: a) allocate a sequential number to the Change Control Note; b) evaluate the Change Control Note and either: i. request further information in writing, which the Supplier shall promptly provide; or ii. discuss the terms of the Change Control Note with the Supplier and request in writing amendments thereto; or iii. approve the Change Control Note, as submitted by the Supplier or as amended pursuant to sub-Clause (2) above; or iv. reject the Change Control Note. 36.7 Buyer shall notify the Supplier of its approval or rejection of the Change Control Note. No such notice shall be valid unless signed by a duly authorised signatory of Buyer. 36.8 If Buyer and the Supplier agree a Change and the relevant Change Control Note then signature of the Change Control Note and any supplement or amendment thereto by both parties shall constitute a formal amendment to the Agreement to the extent only specified in the Change Control Note and any such supplement or amendment. 36.9 Any charges specified in a Change Control Note shall, unless expressly stated otherwise in the Change Control Note, be the maximum cost of the Change. 36.10 If the Supplier modifies the whole or any part of the Services and/or Deliverables in accordance with any Change, it shall make all appropriate related modifications to the Specification(s), the Documentation and any other relevant documents, the cost of which (if any) shall be included within the charges specified in the Change Control Note, and such amended documents when approved in writing by Buyer shall be the applicable documents for the purpose of the SOW. 36.11 Any work which is the subject of a Change and undertaken by the Supplier or the Supplier Contractor or Supplier Personnel which has not been authorised in advance by a Change to the relevant SOW, and which has not been otherwise agreed in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 36 shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, be undertaken entirely at the expense and liability of the Supplier. 36.12 No amendments to the SOW or this Base Agreement shall be valid and no Change or Contract Change shall be effective unless and until they have been agreed in writing by the Buyer Authorised Representative and Supplier Authorised Representative 37.0 Dispute Resolution Procedure 37.1 Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with this Clause 37. 37.2 Prior to the initiation of the alternative dispute resolution procedures identified in Clauses 37.9 through to 37.14 or referring the Dispute to the courts in accordance with Clause 37.14, the parties will first attempt to resolve their Dispute informally in accordance with Clauses 37.4 and 37.5. 37.3 Unless concluded in a written legally binding agreement all negotiations connected with the Dispute shall be conducted in confidence and without prejudice to the rights of the parties in any future proceedings. 37.4 All Disputes shall initially be referred to the Buyer Authorised Representative and Supplier Authorised Representative who shall attempt to resolve the Dispute in a mutually satisfactory manner. 37.5 If any Dispute remains unresolved after a period of five (5) Working Days following a referral to the Authorised Representatives of each party under Clause 37.4 the Dispute shall be referred, by notice from either party to the other summarising the issues, to the Relationship Manager of each party. 37.6 If any Dispute remains unresolved after a period of five (5) Working Days following a referral to the Relationship Managers of each party under Clause 37.5, the Dispute shall be referred by notice from either party to the other summarising the issues to Delivery Engagement Manager at Buyer and Chief Operations Officer at the Supplier . 37.7 If any Dispute remains unresolved after a period of ten (10) Working Days following a referral to the Delivery Engagement Manager at Buyer and Chief Operations Officer at the Supplier the Dispute may be referred by either party to the Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent) of the other party. 37.8 If any Dispute remains unresolved after a period of five (5) Working Days following a referral to the Chief Executive Officers (or equivalents) of the parties, the parties shall seek to resolve the Dispute in accordance with Clause 37.9. 37.9 Following a failure of the Chief Executive Officers to resolve a Dispute under Clause 37.8, the parties agree that structured negotiations will be entered into with the assistance of a neutral advisor (\" Neutral Advisor\" ). The Neutral Advisor will either be agreed on by the parties, or, in the absence of agreement, by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (\" CEDR \"). 37.10 The parties shall, within fourteen (14) days of the appointment of the Neutral Adviser, meet with him/her in order to agree a programme for the exchange of any relevant information and the structure to be adopted for the negotiations which, unless otherwise agreed, will take the form of CEDR's model executive tribunal procedure in force at the relevant date. 37.11 If the parties accept the Neutral Adviser’s recommendations or otherwise reach agreement on the resolution of the Dispute, such agreement will be reduced to writing and, once it is signed by the Authorised Representatives of each party, will be binding on the parties. 37.12 If the parties fail to reach agreement in the structured negotiations within ten (10) Working Days of the Neutral Adviser being appointed, or if either party fails or refuses to participate in or withdraws from participating in the procedure then either party may refer the Dispute for resolution by the courts in accordance with Clause 37.14. 37.13 Unless agreed otherwise by the parties, each party will bear its own costs and expenses associated with participating in the dispute resolution process in accordance with Clauses 37.9 through to 37.12. The liability to pay any third party costs including fees payable to the Neutral Adviser and in relation to the hiring of a venue will be split equally between the parties. 37.14 In the event that the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute by the application of the informal and/or alternative dispute resolution procedures set out in Clauses 37.4 to 37.8 either party may elect to seek recourse through the courts of England which will have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of any such Disputes. 37.15 Nothing in this Clause 37 shall prevent a party from: c) seeking injunctive relief at any time it considers it appropriate to do so; d) referring a matter to the courts in circumstances where a claim might otherwise become time barred; or e) provided Resolution Procedure has been followed, withdrawing from the dispute resolution processes set out in this Clause 37 and commence court proceedings relating to any Dispute arising from this Agreement.. 37.16 Buyer and the Supplier will continue to perform their respective obligations under the relevant SOW pending the resolution of a Dispute, provided that nothing in this Clause prevents or restricts a party from lawfully exercising any of its rights in accordance with Clause 21 (Termination) at any time. 38.0 Subcontracting 38.1 Except with the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and other than as detailed in this Clause 38, the Supplier shall not appoint an agent or contractor in respect of the whole or any part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, other than those detailed in Clause 38.2. For the avoidance of doubt, any actual or proposed appointment of any member of the Supplier Group as an agent or contractor shall be subject to the provisions of this Clause 38. 38.2 The following are approved sub-contractors for the purposes of this Agreement: 3$^{rd}$ Base Ltd Registered number: 981 of 1999 Registered Address: Phone Support Company X Registered number: Registered Address : Development Registered number: Registered Address: Design Registered number: Registered Address: Hosting Registered number: Registered Address: Messaging Registered number: Registered Address: Managed Services (Call Centre) 38.3 If Supplier appoints an agent or contractor, the Supplier shall be fully liable for the defaults, acts and omissions of that agent or contractor or any member of Supplier Personnel as fully as if they were the acts or omissions of the Supplier and will ensure that each such sub-contractor will be bound to comply with the Buyer’s and Customer’s policies and procedures as set out in this Base Agreement or a SOW. 38.4 Prior to appointing an agent or contractor in respect of any of its obligations, the Supplier shall ensure that it has a formal written contract with each such agent or contractor which contains terms and conditions which are the same as or materially equivalent to, and not inconsistent with, the following terms and conditions of this Base Agreement which impose obligations on the Supplier and which are relevant to the subcontract: Clause 15 (Intellectual Property Rights and Buyer Data ), Clause 22.2 (Assignment and Transfer), Clause 22.7 (Exchange of Information), Clause 27 (Data Protection), Clause 29 (IT Security), Clause 32 (Record Keeping, Audit Rights and Regulatory Assistance), and Clause 38 (Subcontracting). 38.5 However, this does not prevent Supplier from using individual contractors who are not legally classified as employees of Supplier. 39.0 Co-operation 39.1 In connection with the performance of its obligations under the relevant SOW and this Base Agreement the Supplier shall co-operate with the Buyer, Customer Group, their Regulatory Authorities and their existing or future third party service providers including (during Termination Assistance) any Successor Supplier. 39.2 Without limiting the foregoing or any other obligation of the Supplier under this Agreement, the Supplier shall liaise with relevant third party services providers detailed in a SOW and provide all reasonable assistance to support Buyer in ensuring that their goods or services are integrated into and compatible with the provision of the Services and/or Deliverables in order to achieve utility of the goods and services in question for the Customer Group, provided that Supplier shall have the right (if Supplier believes such assistance will unreasonably increase its costs) to request Buyer to pay for the provision of such assistance at the Agreed Rates and shall not be required to provide such assistance unless Buyer agrees to pay for such assistance in accordance with such request and Buyer issues Supplier a WA for the agreed costs. 40.0 Not Used 41.0 Costs Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, completion and implementation of: i. this Base Agreement; ii. all ancillary documents relating to this Base Agreement; iii. SOWs pursuant to this Base Agreement and iv. any Contract Changes or Changes to this Base Agreement or such ancillary documents. 42.0 Further Assurance Each party shall do and execute, or arrange and procure for the doing and executing of, any act and/or document reasonably requested of it by any other party to implement and give full effect to the Agreement.
